12.0.0:
- have GUI done with insh.
- startup.insh, event.insh.
- cleanup MEMPHYS_vis/main to have mainly MEMPHYS sim init and declaration of insh commands.
- have insh and -terminal mode.

11.2.0 :
- have inexlib/ourex/geant4.10.03.p01 : clearly users have problems to build
  by using a "sys geant4" (a pre installed geant4). Then we restore a more
  straightforward build by embarquing geant4 in the source packing. Moreover
  our "build distrib" is not ready for a "sys geant4" having not the archive libs
  (then having only shared libs), and asking people to install geant4 with archive
  (having the cmake "-DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON") complicate their life.
- inexlib/exlib/exlib/app/Windows/app_main_cpp.

11.0.0 : Visualization of the MEMPHYS simulation done with the softinex tools.
- X11 : option -verbose restore Geant4 output that are disconnected by default.
- plot : hits edep.
- PMS represented with inlib::sg::bifacet (more effective than sg::tube).
- "axes" menu item.
- "cam top toward -z" menu item.
- params => gui_font_modeling : can set now "font_pixmap" which gives a better rendering of texts.
- Windows, iOS, Android with ourex/geant4.10.03.p01.
- Android : inputEventFile => input.memphys, jobOptions.mac => job_options.mac.
- mgr/use_geant4 : for g410x, use ourex/geant4.10.03.p01.
- * : modifs to remove "pedantic warnings" if compiling with the "geant4-config --cflags" options.

10.1.0 :
- build with clang++ on iridium.
- First version of the visualisation done on inlib/sg in the distrib.
- DetectorConstruction : tilt "Rock" so that it is not inside the WC tank ! See "_y -= " code with //GB comment.

10.0.0 : 12 July 2017 :
- over geant4 10.03.p01.
- Have it on Windows-10/VC-14.
